Protoplaster system report
==================
Protoplaster provides `protoplaster-system-report`, a tool to obtain information about system state and configuration. It executes a list of commands and saves their outputs. The outputs are stored in a single zip archive together with an HTML summary. An example summary can be found <a href="_static/system_report_summary.html">here</a>.

The following config was used to generate the example:
