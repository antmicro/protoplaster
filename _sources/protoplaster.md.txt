To perform hardware/BSP tests and open-source [Protoplaster](https://github.com/antmicro/protoplaster)  framework has been used.

Running Protoplaster runs the tests described in the following chapters:

I2C devices tests
-----------------

This module provides tests dedicated to i2c devices on specific buses:

* /dev/i2c-0:

  * detection test for *Sensor name* on address: `0x3c`


* /dev/i2c-0:

  * detection test for *I2C-bus multiplexer* on address: `0x70`



GPIOs tests
-----------

This module provides tests dedicated to GPIO on specific pin number

* /sys/class/gpio/gpio20:

  * write `1` and read back to confirm



Camera sensor tests
-------------------

This module provides tests dedicated to V4L devices on specific video node:

* vivid:

  * try to capture frame

  * check if the camera sensor name is `vivid`

  * check if the camera sensor driver name is `vivid`


* vivid:

  * try to capture frameand store it to `frame.raw` file

  * check if the camera sensor name is `vivid`

  * check if the camera sensor driver name is `vivid`
