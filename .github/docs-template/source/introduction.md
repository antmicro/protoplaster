# Introduction

This documentation serves as an example of how individual projects documentation can look like.

The second chapter contains information from the README file.

The last chapter is generated from the sample ``test.yml`` file which can be found in the README.
Its purpose is to demonstrate the documentation generated to describe test procedures used in a project.
