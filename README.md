Protoplaster expects a yaml file describing tests as an input. The yaml file should have a structure specified as follows:

<!-- name="example" -->
```yaml
base:                # A group specifier
  i2c:               # A module specifier
  - bus: 0           # An interface specifier
    devices:         # Multiple instances of devices can be defined in one module
    - name: "Sensor name"
      address: 0x3c  # The given device parameters determine which tests will be run for the module
  - bus: 0
    devices:
    - name: "I2C-bus multiplexer"
      address: 0x70
  camera:
  - device: "/dev/video0"
    camera_name: "vivid"
    driver_name: "vivid"
  - device: "/dev/video2"
    camera_name: "vivid"
    driver_name: "vivid"
    save_file: "frame.raw"
additional:
  gpio:
  - number: 20
    value: 1
```

### Groups
In the YAML file, you can define different groups of tests to run them for different use cases. 
In the YAML file example, there are two groups defined: base and additional. 
Protoplaster, when run without a defined group, will execute every test in each group. 
When the group is specified with the parameter `-g` or `--group`, only the tests in the specified group are going to be run. 
You can also list existing groups in the YAML file, simply run `protoplaster --list-groups test.yaml`.

## Base modules parameters
Each base module requires parameters for test initialization. 
These parameters describe the tests and are passed to the test class as its attributes.

### I2C
Required parameters:

* `bus` - i2c bus to be checked
* `name` - name of device to be detected
* `address` - address of the device to be detected on the indicated bus

### GPIO
Required parameters:

* `number` - GPIO pin number
* `value` - value written to that pin

Optional parameters:

* `gpio_name` - name of the sysfs GPIO interface after exporting

### Cameras
Required parameters:

* `device` - path to the camera device (eg. /dev/video0)
* `camera_name` - expected camera name
* `driver_name` - expected driver name

Optional parameters:

* `save_file` - a path which the tested frame is saved to (the frame is saved only if this parameter is present)

### FPGA
Required parameters:

* `sysfs_interface` - path to a sysfs interface for flashing the bitstream to the FPGA
* `bitstream_path` - path to a test bitstream that is going to be flashed

## Writing additional modules
Apart from base modules available in Protoplaster, you can provide your own extended modules. 
The module should contain a `test.py` file in the root path. 
This file should contain a test class that is decorated with `ModuleName("")` from the `protoplaster.conf.module` package.
This decorator tells Protoplaster what the name of the module is. 
With this information, Protoplaster can correctly initialize the test parameters. 
The test class should contain a `name()` method. Its return value is used for the `device_name` field in CSV output.

The description of the external module should be added to the YAML file as for other tests. 
By default, external modules are expected in the `/etc/protoplaster` directory. 
If you want to store them in a different path, use the `--custom-tests` argument to set your own path. 
Individual tests run by Protoplaster should be present in the main class in the `test.py` file. 
The class's name should start with `Test`, and every test's name in this class should also start with `test`. 
An example of an extended module test:

```python
from protoplaster.conf.module import ModuleName

@ModuleName("additional_camera")
class TestAdditionalCamera:
    """
    {% macro TestAdditionalCamera(prefix) -%}
    Additional camera tests
    -----------------------
    {% do prefix.append('') %}
    This module provides tests dedicated to camera sensors on specific video node:
    {%- endmacro %}
    """

    def test_exists(self):
        """
        {% macro test_exists(device) -%}
          check if the path exists
        {%- endmacro %}
        """
        assert self.path == "/dev/video0"
```

And a YAML definition:

```yaml
---
base:
  additional_camera:
    - path: "/dev/video0"
    - path: "/dev/video1"
```

## Protoplaster test report
Protoplaster provides `protoplaster-test-report`, a tool to convert test CSV output into a HTML or Markdown table.
```
usage: protoplaster-test-report [-h] [-i INPUT_FILE] -t {md,html} [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        Path to the csv file
  -t {md,html}, --type {md,html}
                        Output type
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to the output file
```


## System report
Protoplaster provides `protoplaster-system-report`, a tool for obtaining information about system state and configuration.
It executes a list of commands and saves their outputs. 
The outputs are stored in a single zip archive along with an HTML summary.

### Usage
```
usage: protoplaster-system-report [-h] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-c CONFIG] [--sudo]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Path to the output file
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Path to the YAML config file
  --sudo                Run as sudo
```

The YAML config contains a list of actions to perform. A single action is described as follows:

```yaml
report_item_name:
  run: script
  summary:
    - title: summary_title
      run: summary_script
  output: script_output_file
  superuser: required | preferred
  on-fail: ...
```

* `run` - command to be run
* `summary` – a list of summary generators, each one with fields:
  * `title` – summary title
  * `run` – command that generates the summary. This command gets the output of the original command as stdin. This field is optional; if not specified, the output is placed in the report as-is.
* `output` - output file for the output of `run`.
* `superuser` – optional, should be specified if the command requires elevated privileges to run. Possible values:
  * `required` – `protoplaster-system-report` will terminate if the privilege requirement is not met
  * `preferred` – if the privilege requirement is not met, a warning will be issued and this particular item won't be included in the report
* `on-fail` – optional description of an item to run in case of failure. It can be used to run an alternative command when the original one fails or is not available.

Example config file:
<!-- name="system-report-example" -->
```yaml
uname:
  run: uname -a
  summary:
    - title: os info
      run: cat
  output: uname.out
dmesg:
  run: dmesg
  summary: 
    - title: usb
      run: grep usb
    - title: v4l
      run: grep v4l
  output: dmesg.out
  superuser: required
ip:
  run: ip a
  summary:
    - title: Network interfaces state
      run: python3 $PROTOPLASTER_SCRIPTS/generate_ip_table.py "$(cat)"
  output: ip.out
  on-fail:
    run: ifconfig -a
    summary:
      - title: Network interfaces state
        run: python3 $PROTOPLASTER_SCRIPTS/generate_ifconfig_table.py "$(cat)"
    output: ifconfig.out
```

### Running as root
By default, `sudo` doesn't preserve `PATH`. 
To run `protoplaster-system-report` installed by a non-root user as root, invoke `protoplaster-system-report --sudo`
